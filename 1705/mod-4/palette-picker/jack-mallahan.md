## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I was able to complete all functionality, but I was not able to complete all of my testing. I needed help with my seed file and didn't receive it until this morning. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

I did not complete any extensions

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jackmallahan/palette-picker/blob/c1992b1ec7b959182abcf8008fd92e248db2a9ce/public/js/scripts.js#L29-L43)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I just thought this was a fun piece of code. The front end stuff like this is what I really enjoy writing. Making my title have random colors for each letter is a completely superfluous function, but it is fun.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/jackmallahan/palette-picker/blob/c1992b1ec7b959182abcf8008fd92e248db2a9ce/db/seeds/test/test.js#L51-L71)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I don't like this code because I don't fully understand it. I ran out of time and leaned heavily on David for help on this. I understand that I am just passing down promises, but I don't think I could have written in without looking at [this](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/knex-postgres.html) lesson and having David's help. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I made some good progress and wrote some code that I am definitely proud of. I ran out of time/mental space and didn't get as much done as I liked. I really loved writing the front end code for this and had fun with that. I think this was a good introduction to writing with Express and I definitely need to hone my skills in this area.
